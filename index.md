-    “Hack the World & Galaxy with OSINT” - Chris Kubecka


The more we strive to connect every part the world with IT, IOT & ICS SCADA assets running on legacy and existing infrastructure with IPv6 and upcoming 5G & 6E. The risk of finding connected, insecure assets containing juicy info which can be leveraged by naughty groups rises. How easy is it to find vulnerable databases, solar panels, smart homes, washing machines, space IOT, maritime assets and critical infrastructure? Using OSINT Open source intelligence gathering, an important part of the reconnaissance phase of a application security penetration test. Learning what sources of information is available to start a penetration test is a crucial step in completing a thorough but effective exploration. Risks associated with leveraging, misusing or selling discovered material are all too real. Get your hoodie out and join us on a journey of discovery and exploitation of high profile industrial controls systems spanning land, sea, air and space using legal tools & techniques. Key takeaways include closing the gaps and securing these systems.

-    “Common API Security Pitfalls” - Philippe De Ryck


The shift towards an API landscape indicates a significant evolution in the way we build applications. The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you need to take into account? These are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.
